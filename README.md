1.) Treat everyone with respect. Absolutely no harassment, witch hunting, sexism, racism, or hate speech will be tolerated.
2.) No spam or self-promotion (server invites, advertisements, etc) without permission from a staff member. This includes DMing fellow members.
3.) No NSFW or obscene content. This includes text, images, or links featuring nudity, sex, hard violence, or other graphically disturbing content.
4.) AGE RESTRICTION: You Must be 13+ to be in this community! If you are not you will be Kicked or banned (if you continue to return without being the proper age) from this community.
5.) If you see something against the rules or something that makes you feel unsafe, let staff know. We want this server to be a welcoming space!
6.) Most importantly, HAVE FUN! 
Again please follow these Rules & Regulations... If you do not, you will be kicked or banned from the server (Depending on the severity of the action.)
